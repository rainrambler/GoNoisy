# GoNoisy

Go port of Noisy (https://github.com/1tayH/noisy), a simple python script that generates random HTTP/DNS traffic noise in the background while you go about your regular web browsing, to make your web traffic data less valuable for selling and for extra obscurity.

Tested on MacOS High Sierra. It should not depend on a specific version of Golang.
